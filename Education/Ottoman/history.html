                    <p>Turkey, country that occupies a unique geographic position, lying partly in Asia and partly in
                        Europe.
                        Throughout its history it has acted as both a barrier and a bridge between the two
                        continents.Turkey is
                        situated at the crossroads of the Balkans, Caucasus, Middle East, and eastern Mediterranean. It
                        is among the
                        larger countries of the region in terms of territory and population, and its land area is
                        greater than that
                        of any European state. Nearly all of the country is in Asia, comprising the oblong peninsula of
                        Asia
                        Minor—also known as Anatolia (Anadolu)—and, in the east, part of a mountainous region sometimes
                        known as the
                        Armenian Highland. The remainder—Turkish Thrace (Trakya)—lies in the extreme southeastern part
                        of Europe, a
                        tiny remnant of an empire that once extended over much of the Balkans.</p>
